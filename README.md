This is how I solved all the 'Basic Algorithm Scripting' in Free Code Camp.

All of these algorithms were solved and passed the FCC challenges in January 2017. I don't know if they have made any changes to these challenges, if they have done any change, these solutions might not work. If you see any that doesn't work and feel like telling me, please do. I will happily try to fix them.

The way I solved these algorithms is not the only way of doing it, and might not be the best. But all of them passed the challenge. It's quite possible that if I had to solve any of them nowadays I would do it different and maybe better, but one of the goals of this repository is to show how I did it with what I knew, so if anyone with the knowledge I had then comes here, could understand the code that is written here. If I change them to be 'better written' (either by me or any developer I know), it wouldn't follow the idea that brought me to this point.

Thus it comes the second goal of this repository. That is that any 'camper' from Free Code Camp can have the solution to these challenges if they find themselves stuck with a challenge, or even if they have solved it, they can see how others did it.

What I will change is some real errors or styling. For instance, taking away semicolons or translating spanish comments to english.

- First Commit: As is. Some files are already changed (comments in english, no unnecessary semicolons, etc.) but not all, so they will be changed through time and pushed to this GH repository.

Legend:
  - There are some algorithms that I solved in more than one way, by different reasons. You'll find them with an ending such as 'v1' or 'v2'. Both should pass the FCC challenge.
  - The algorithm with 'R-version' was solved also two times. One by me and another by a senior front-end developer so it might not be as easy to read as the rest.
  - 'TBF' means 'To Be Fixed', I still have to check why I thought it had to be fixed. And when it is fixed, the 'TBF' will be taken away from the name.
